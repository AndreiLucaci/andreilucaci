## Founding Engineer / Tech Lead / Senior Software Engineer

### Founding Engineer

I'm working with an awesome team to deliver the right balance between software quality and software readiness. Startup world is a challenging ecosystem, and you should always be ready to React (no pun intended) to what's happening around you. And that might be changes to your product, software, goals, team, mindset!

### Back-end

Building cloud web applications that help people connect and handle business better, faster, and more reliable. With an async mindset, I'm trying to decouple complex web structures and components to generate reactive self containing services (RSCSs) able to handle stress factors from various sources.

### Consultancy

As well as providing development services, I also help people decide strategic roadmaps by providing consultancy services.

> “Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value. He is considered successful in our day who gets more out of life than he puts in. But a man of value will give more than he receives.” — Albert Einstein

### 🧭 Building with Purpose  
I work at the intersection of **architecture, purpose, and people**: designing systems that last and leading teams that care about what they build.  

From startups to enterprise platforms, I aim to **balance software quality with readiness**, crafting systems that are maintainable, observable, and meaningful.  

I build with **intent**, focusing on clarity over complexity, and helping teams navigate growth without losing their soul.

### 🧱 Back-End Engineering  
I design distributed systems using **.NET, Node.js, and React**: resilient, decoupled, and cloud-ready.  
With an asynchronous mindset, I structure services around autonomy and stability, generating **Reactive Self-Contained Services (RSCS)** able to handle real-world stress.  

My architectural focus includes:  
- Clean, event-driven systems  
- Hangfire / Quartz / Orleans orchestration  
- Multi-tenant data and compute pipelines  
- Observability, tracing, and developer experience
